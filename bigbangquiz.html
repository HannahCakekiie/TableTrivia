        answer: "The beginning of the universe", 
        trivia: "The Big Bang Theory explains how the universe began from an incredibly hot, dense state around 13.8 billion years ago."
    },
    { 
        question: "Who first proposed the idea that the universe is expanding?", 
        choices: ["Isaac Newton", "Albert Einstein", "Georges Lemaître", "Edwin Hubble"], 
        answer: "Georges Lemaître", 
        trivia: "Belgian priest and astronomer Georges Lemaître proposed the idea of an expanding universe, which later supported the Big Bang Theory."
    },
    { 
        question: "Which scientist's observations confirmed the universe is expanding?", 
        choices: ["Albert Einstein", "Galileo Galilei", "Stephen Hawking", "Edwin Hubble"], 
        answer: "Edwin Hubble", 
        trivia: "In 1929, Edwin Hubble observed that galaxies are moving away from us, leading to the discovery of the universe’s expansion."
    },
    { 
        question: "What is the name of the leftover radiation from the Big Bang?", 
        choices: ["Gamma rays", "Cosmic microwave background", "Solar radiation", "X-rays"], 
        answer: "Cosmic microwave background", 
        trivia: "The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is faint radiation from the Big Bang, discovered in 1965 by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson."
    },
    { 
        question: "What does redshift tell us about distant galaxies?", 
        choices: ["They are moving closer", "They are rotating faster", "They are moving away", "They are shrinking"], 
        answer: "They are moving away", 
        trivia: "Redshift occurs when light stretches as galaxies move away, supporting the idea of an expanding universe."
    },
    { 
        question: "What is believed to have existed before the Big Bang?", 
        choices: ["A massive star", "Time and space", "A singularity", "Dark matter"], 
        answer: "A singularity", 
        trivia: "The Big Bang Theory suggests everything was once compressed into an infinitely small, hot, and dense point — a singularity."
    },
    { 
        question: "How long after the Big Bang did the first atoms form?", 
        choices: ["A few minutes", "A few hours", "A few years", "Immediately"], 
        answer: "A few minutes", 
        trivia: "Around 3 minutes after the Big Bang, temperatures dropped enough for hydrogen and helium nuclei to form."

        question: "Which element was most abundant right after the Big Bang?", 
        choices: ["Oxygen", "Carbon", "Hydrogen", "Iron"], 
        answer: "Hydrogen", 
        trivia: "Hydrogen, the simplest and lightest element, formed first, making up about 75% of the early universe's matter."
    },
    { 
        question: "What is dark energy’s role in the expanding universe?", 
        choices: ["It slows expansion", "It pulls galaxies together", "It speeds up expansion", "It creates new galaxies"], 
        answer: "It speeds up expansion", 
        trivia: "Dark energy is a mysterious force believed to accelerate the universe's expansion over time."
    },
    { 
        question: "What event started the Big Bang?", 
        choices: ["An explosion", "A collision of galaxies", "A rapid expansion", "The birth of a star"], 
        answer: "A rapid expansion", 
        trivia: "The Big Bang wasn’t an explosion — it was a rapid expansion of space itself from a singular point."
    },
    { 
        question: "What temperature was the universe moments after the Big Bang?", 
        choices: ["Absolute zero", "Billions of degrees", "Room temperature", "1000°C"], 
        answer: "Billions of degrees", 
        trivia: "Just after the Big Bang, the universe’s temperature was over 1 billion degrees Celsius."

        question: "Which famous physicist's equations supported the idea of an expanding universe?", 
        choices: ["Isaac Newton", "Stephen Hawking", "Albert Einstein", "Nikola Tesla"], 
        answer: "Albert Einstein", 
        trivia: "Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity predicted an expanding universe, though he initially resisted the idea."

        choices: ["The rise in cosmic temperature", "The rapid expansion just after the Big Bang", "The increase in galaxies", "The cooling of the universe"], 
        answer: "The rapid expansion just after the Big Bang", 
        trivia: "Cosmic inflation is a brief period of extremely rapid expansion that occurred fractions of a second after the Big Bang."

        question: "What is the universe’s ultimate fate according to the Big Freeze theory?", 
        choices: ["It will collapse", "It will expand forever and cool down", "It will explode again", "It will turn into a black hole"], 
        answer: "It will expand forever and cool down", 
        trivia: "The Big Freeze predicts the universe will expand indefinitely, eventually becoming cold and dark as stars burn out."
